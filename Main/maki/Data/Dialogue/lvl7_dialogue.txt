Lunch was good! Don’t you just love the ambience here at the Fishing Village? I know I do!
Hmmm, we have quite a few delivery orders today. Let me teach you the way to collect the orders with the   right condiments.
First, check the order list. On the top of the list, we have Salmon with Wasabi sauce. To collect them, we push our ingredient, Salmon into the Wasabi tile.
Oh no, wrong condiments. You can remove it by using the Tea tile.
Becareful, the Tea tile will REMOVE ALL the condiments.
Now, let’s complete the order by pushing the ingredient into the Wasabi tile and into the plastic container for delivery!
