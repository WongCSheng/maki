Components Understanding
Each GameObject contains is a an ID for which components it owns. It doesn't actually hold the component itself. That is left to the component manager to do.

Factories are then the managaer for GameObjects.

The Component Manager contains the actual containers that holds each component that is created.
Components holds the actual data for each objects it is assigned to.
For example: Boundary, Textures, Transform etc.

Generally Components are suppose to be generally flexible in their types, so adding new components will be easier and more dynamic in the future.
